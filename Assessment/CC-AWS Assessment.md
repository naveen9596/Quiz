Here are sample assessment questions for cloud computing on AWS at different levels: beginner, intermediate, and advanced.

---

### **Beginner Level:**

1. **Describe AWS and explain its main advantages over traditional on-premises data centers.**
   - **Guidelines**: Focus on elasticity, scalability, cost-effectiveness, and global reach.

2. **What is Amazon S3, and how does it differ from Amazon EBS?**
   - **Guidelines**: Compare S3 (object storage) and EBS (block storage), use cases, and accessibility.

3. **Explain the process of launching an EC2 instance.**
   - **Guidelines**: Step-by-step instructions, including instance types, AMIs, security groups, and key pairs.

4. **What are the basic pricing models in AWS, and how does the pay-as-you-go model work?**
   - **Guidelines**: Explain On-Demand, Reserved Instances, and Spot Instances.

5. **How do AWS regions and availability zones support high availability?**
   - **Guidelines**: Define regions, availability zones, and how they ensure data redundancy and fault tolerance.

### **Intermediate Level:**

1. **Explain the concept of auto-scaling in AWS. How can it help optimize both performance and cost?**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss Auto Scaling groups, scaling policies, and load balancing.

2. **What are the differences between Amazon RDS and DynamoDB? When would you choose one over the other?**
   - **Guidelines**: Contrast relational and NoSQL databases, covering consistency models and scalability.

3. **Describe how IAM roles and policies help in managing security in AWS.**
   - **Guidelines**: Provide examples of least privilege, roles for EC2, and how policies define permissions.

4. **Explain how Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) distributes traffic and enhances the reliability of applications.**
   - **Guidelines**: Cover the various types (Application, Network, Gateway), health checks, and cross-zone load balancing.

5. **Describe a scenario where you would use Amazon S3 Glacier instead of Amazon S3 Standard.**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss use cases for long-term storage, access latency, and cost optimization.

### **Advanced Level:**

1. **You need to design a multi-region, high-availability architecture for a web application that experiences variable traffic. Describe how you would use AWS services to achieve this.**
   - **Guidelines**: Mention services like Route 53 (DNS routing), Auto Scaling, ELB, RDS Multi-AZ, and S3 for storage.

2. **Explain how AWS Direct Connect can improve network performance compared to VPN for hybrid cloud solutions.**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss dedicated vs. shared connections, latency, security, and use cases for hybrid environments.

3. **Describe how you would implement a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway for a RESTful service.**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss how functions are triggered, API management, and scaling with Lambda.

4. **How does Amazon CloudWatch integrate with AWS services to provide operational monitoring and alerting? Provide examples of custom metrics you might track.**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss metrics for EC2, RDS, Lambda, etc., alarms, dashboards, and custom metrics like application-specific logs.

5. **Design a CI/CD pipeline using AWS services such as CodeCommit, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline. Explain how these services work together to automate deployment.**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss version control, build automation, testing, deployment, and integrating these into a continuous deployment strategy.
