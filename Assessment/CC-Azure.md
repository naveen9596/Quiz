Here are sample assessment questions for cloud computing on **Microsoft Azure** for beginner, intermediate, and advanced levels:

---

### **Beginner Level:**

1. **What is Microsoft Azure, and what are the key benefits of using it for cloud computing?**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss scalability, flexibility, pay-as-you-go model, and global availability.

2. **Explain the difference between IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS in the context of Azure services.**
   - **Guidelines**: Provide examples of Azure services for each model (e.g., IaaS - Azure Virtual Machines, PaaS - Azure App Service, SaaS - Office 365).

3. **What is Azure Virtual Machine, and how would you launch one?**
   - **Guidelines**: Include steps such as selecting an image, choosing a size, configuring networking, and creating the VM.

4. **What is Azure Blob Storage, and what types of data is it best suited for?**
   - **Guidelines**: Define Blob Storage and its uses for unstructured data such as text, images, and backups.

5. **How does Azure provide high availability through regions and availability zones?**
   - **Guidelines**: Explain the global distribution of Azure data centers and how regions and availability zones support redundancy.

---

### **Intermediate Level:**

1. **What are Azure Availability Sets and Availability Zones, and how do they differ in providing high availability?**
   - **Guidelines**: Explain fault domains, update domains in Availability Sets, and physical separation of zones in a region.

2. **Explain the concept of Azure Resource Groups. Why are they important in managing Azure resources?**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss how resource groups are used for organizing resources and managing policies, billing, and access.

3. **What is Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), and how does it differ from traditional Active Directory?**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss the differences in cloud-based vs. on-premises directories, identity management, and integration with Azure services.

4. **How does Azure Load Balancer distribute traffic across virtual machines, and what are its key features?**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss types of load balancers (internal and external), session persistence, and health probes.

5. **What is Azure SQL Database, and how does it compare to hosting a SQL Server instance on an Azure Virtual Machine?**
   - **Guidelines**: Compare the managed service approach of Azure SQL Database with the flexibility and management responsibilities of hosting SQL Server on VMs.

### **Advanced Level:**

1. **Design an architecture using Azure services for a globally distributed application with low latency and high availability. Explain your service choices.**
   - **Guidelines**: Include services such as Azure Traffic Manager, Azure Front Door, Cosmos DB, and Azure CDN for geo-replication and load balancing.

2. **How would you implement a hybrid cloud solution using Azure services? Discuss Azure Arc, VPN Gateway, or Azure ExpressRoute in your answer.**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss extending on-premises infrastructure with Azure Arc for management, and compare secure connection options like VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute.

3. **Explain how you would create and manage a DevOps CI/CD pipeline using Azure DevOps services.**
   - **Guidelines**: Include steps for setting up repositories (Azure Repos), automating builds (Azure Pipelines), and deploying applications (Azure Artifacts, Azure Test Plans).

4. **How does Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) simplify the deployment and management of containerized applications, and what are some best practices for AKS?**
   - **Guidelines**: Discuss AKS for orchestrating containers, scaling strategies, integration with Azure Monitor for logging, and security best practices.

5. **How would you implement a monitoring and alerting solution for a multi-tier Azure application using Azure Monitor and Log Analytics?**
   - **Guidelines**: Cover setting up Azure Monitor for resource metrics, using Log Analytics for querying logs, and configuring action groups for alerts and automation.
